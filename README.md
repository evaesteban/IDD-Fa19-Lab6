# ChatBot

*A lab report by Eva Pilar Esteban Velasco*

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I implemented a bilingual survey for a sightseeing tour. It starts by greeting the user, thanking them for taking the survey, and asking if they prefer to take the survey in Spanish or English. When the user specifies the language, the survey starts in that language, asking several questions and interacting with the user. I also changed the background color to purple (my favourite color) and the font to white in order for it to be more visible. Link to a video of a someone using the chatbot in Spanish, and then in English can be found below.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
